    <h2>All About Me</h2>

    <p>I initially, after graduating, went to college at the Interamerican University in Puerto Rico. In my second year I joined the United States Navy. I served 12 years in naval communications. When I left the Navy, I worked as a Defence Contractor; installing, removing, and upgrading combat systems aboard ships.</p>

    <p>My love of tech began to grow and I went back to school to Old Dominion University for network systems. I worked for approximately a year building, developing, and administering networks for the Department of the Navy. That is, until a class in Fiber Optics put me on a path to public communications with the phone company. Eight years later it was back to school.</p>

    <p>I finished my bachelors degree at the University of Pheonix with a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. Back into the military I went, Army this time, to finish what I had started so many years ago. The Army made me a diesel mechanic. A skill I didn't know I had or needed. But after eight more years, I finally finished with my military career.</p>

    <p>Finally it was time to decide what I was going to do with the rest of my life. In college I had taken some coding classes and had enjoyed the challenges, variety and creativity that they sparked. Everything was always new and exciting. Solving the puzzles and making it all work was my cup of tea. Researching schools to update my skills, I found Epicodus in a tech <a href="https://tech.co/top-33-coding-bootcamps-2015-02">article</a> listing it at number one in the top thirty-three in the nation. A little more research and mobile app development<em>(Java, Javascript, and Android to start)</em> here I come.</p>
